EMI stands for Equated Monthly Instalment for the loan you avail from your bank. The EMI consists of the principal portion of the loan amount and the interest. Therefore, EMI = principal amount + interest paid on the loan. The EMI, usually, remains fixed for the entire tenure of your loan, and it is to be repaid over the tenure of the loan on a monthly basis. Here are the some benefits of using the EMI calculator:

1.)  Easy to access
2.)  Saves time and energy instead of performing manual calculations
3.) Provides quick results
4.) Helps you ascertain if the monthly EMI is affordable or not
5.) Aids you in financial planning
